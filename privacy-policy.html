            <li><strong>Referral and Diamond Data:</strong> Referral links, invited users, and earned diamonds for unlocking features like infinite distance matching or permanent messages.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Related Data:</strong> When using planned AI features (e.g., content recommendations or moderation), we may process engagement data and video tags.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide core features like video feeds, matching, chats, and referrals.</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience, such as showing nearby matches or trending videos.</li>
            <li>To manage badges (e.g., Leaf, ThreeLeaf) and diamonds based on referrals.</li>
            <li>For security, fraud prevention, and moderation (e.g., AI content filtering).</li>
            <li>To send notifications and updates via Firebase Cloud Messaging.</li>
            <li>For analytics and improvements using Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Supabase for authentication and database, Wasabi for storage, Bunny CDN for video delivery, and AI providers (e.g., Groq, DeepSeek) for content recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Matched Users:</strong> Profile details and location (anonymized) for matching in Love, Business, or Entertainment modes.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, to protect rights, or in response to legal processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, including encryption, access controls, and regular audits. However, no system is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access, update, or delete your personal information.</li>
            <li>Opt out of location sharing or notifications.</li>
            <li>Request data portability.</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
